# ShoreAgents - Professional Offshore Solutions

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project for ShoreAgents, a leading provider of offshore talent solutions and business process outsourcing services.

## Environment Setup

Before running the application, you need to set up environment variables:

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Edit `.env.local` and add your API keys:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_OPEN_EXCHANGE_RATES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Get your free API key from [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
